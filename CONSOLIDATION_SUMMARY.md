# Server Consolidation Summary

## What Was Changed

### ✅ Consolidated Architecture
- **Before**: React dev server (port 3000) + Node.js API server (port 3001)
- **After**: Single Node.js server (port 3000) serving both React build + APIs

### ✅ Modified Files

#### 1. `server/index.js`
- Added static file serving for React build from `../dist`
- Updated catch-all route to serve `index.html` for SPA routing
- Changed default PORT from 3001 to 3000
- Fixed hardcoded localhost:3001 references
- Updated logging to reflect consolidated setup
- Added API route protection in catch-all handler
- **Updated session cleanup**: Changed from `expiresIn + 5 minutes` to **24 hours**
- **Fixed session restoration**: Added missing `expiresAt` property for proper session recovery

#### 2. `package.json`
- **New scripts**:
  - `dev`: Builds and starts server (quick development)
  - `dev:watch`: Concurrent build watching + server restart (hot-reload)
- **Updated scripts**:
  - `start`: Now builds then starts server
  - `start:prod`: Direct server start (for production)

#### 3. `src/App.js`
- Simplified API_BASE_URL to always use `window.location.origin`
- Removed separate development/production API URLs

#### 4. `webpack.config.js`
- Removed proxy configuration (no longer needed)
- Updated comments to clarify usage

#### 5. `.env`
- Changed PORT from 3001 to 3000

#### 6. `README.md`
- Updated development instructions
- Documented new single-server benefits
- Fixed port references

## ✅ How to Use

### Development
```bash
# Quick development (build + start)
npm run dev

# Development with hot-reload
npm run dev:watch

# Production
npm start
```

### What You Get
- **Single URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **React App**: http://localhost:3000/
- **APIs**: http://localhost:3000/auth/*
- **Health**: http://localhost:3000/health

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment** - Single server to deploy
2. **No CORS Issues** - Same origin for frontend + backend
3. **Better Security** - No cross-origin requests
4. **Azure App Service Ready** - Perfect for cloud deployment
5. **Easier Development** - One URL to remember
6. **Production-Like Setup** - Development mirrors production

## ✅ Compatibility

- ✅ **Local Development**: Works with NODE_ENV=development
- ✅ **Azure App Service**: Works with existing iisnode setup
- ✅ **Production**: Optimized static file serving with caching
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All existing auth endpoints preserved
- ✅ **React Routing**: SPA routing still works with catch-all handler

The application maintains all existing functionality while simplifying the architecture!
