# Azure Deployment Summary

## Created Files

I've successfully created a complete Azure deployment solution for your MSAL Passkey Force application with the following files:

### Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)
- `infra/main.bicep` - Main Bicep template with subscription scope
- `infra/main-resources.bicep` - Resource definitions for App Service, Key Vault, etc.
- `infra/main.parameters.json` - Parameters file for deployment

### Azure Developer CLI Configuration
- `azure.yaml` - AZD configuration file defining the service and infrastructure
- `.azure/dev/.env` - Environment variables for the dev environment
- `.azure/plan.copilotmd` - Deployment plan documentation

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-to-azure.ps1` - Comprehensive PowerShell deployment script with error handling
- `deploy-to-azure.bat` - Simple batch file for basic deployment
- `deploy.cmd` - Kudu deployment script for Azure App Service builds
- `.deployment` - Configuration file telling Azure to use deploy.cmd

### Documentation
- `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide and troubleshooting
- `web.config` - IIS configuration for Node.js hosting on Azure

## Resources to be Created

The deployment will create these Azure resources in `rg-rg-et-trivia-dev`:

1. **App Service**: `app-play-et-trivia-toronto-hub-dev`
   - Premium P1V2 tier (1 Core, 3.5GB RAM)
   - Node.js 18 LTS runtime
   - System + User managed identity enabled
   - HTTPS only, Always On enabled

2. **App Service Plan**: Premium tier with auto-scaling capability

3. **Key Vault**: Secure storage for application secrets
   - Access policy configured for Web App managed identity
   - Standard tier

4. **Application Insights**: Application performance monitoring
   - Connected to Log Analytics workspace
   - Automatic telemetry collection

5. **Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralized logging
   - 30-day retention
   - Pay-per-GB pricing

6. **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Required by AZD rules

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```powershell
# Preview what will be deployed
.\deploy-to-azure.ps1 -Preview

# Deploy to Azure
.\deploy-to-azure.ps1
```

### Alternative Methods
```batch
# Simple deployment
deploy-to-azure.bat
```

Or manually with AZD:
```bash
azd up --environment dev
```

## Security & Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Bicep following Azure best practices
✅ **Managed Identity**: Secure authentication without storing credentials
✅ **Key Vault Integration**: Secrets stored securely and accessed via managed identity  
✅ **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted in transit
✅ **Premium App Service**: Enterprise-grade hosting with advanced security features
✅ **Application Insights**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
✅ **Bicep Best Practices**: Following latest Azure Resource Manager patterns
✅ **AZD Compliance**: Meets all Azure Developer CLI deployment requirements

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Configure Entra ID**: Update your app registration with the deployed URL
2. **Add Secrets to Key Vault**: Store your Azure AD application credentials
3. **Test Authentication**: Verify the passkey and PKCE flows work correctly
4. **Set up Monitoring**: Configure alerts and dashboards in Application Insights

## Cost Estimate
- **App Service Premium P1V2**: ~$73/month
- **Key Vault Standard**: ~$3/month + transactions
- **Application Insights**: Pay-per-GB (typically $5-15/month)
- **Log Analytics**: Pay-per-GB (typically $5-10/month)

**Total estimated**: ~$80-100/month

The deployment is ready to run! Use `.\deploy-to-azure.ps1 -Preview` first to see exactly what will be created, then run `.\deploy-to-azure.ps1` to deploy to your Azure subscription.
